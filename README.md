----DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT---- 
We have decided to create a maze where you have to find the goal room whilst also collecting as much coins as you can get. The maze is full of intricate and confusing paths, so you might end up lost while trying to find the goal

There will be Menu Screen at the beginning to choose options Play Game or Exit
The game will update score point as user collect and collide with coin object
