----DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT---- 
We have decided to create a maze where you have to find the goal room whilst also collecting as much coins as you can get. The maze is full of intricate and confusing paths, so you might end up lost while trying to find the goal.


----INSTALLATION----
To make this program run, you must download both Python and Pygame.

Use the following site to install Python:

Pygame is a set of Python modules that are utilized for creating videogames,
such as making and working with sprites, collision between items, music, and more.
follow the steps below to install Pygame:

(For Windows) Open the command line prompt, and input the following line:
py -m pip install -U pygame --user

(For Mac) Open the Terminal, and input the following line:

----Getting Started----
The game is simple: try to find the goal room while collecting as much coins as you can. Try to keep notes on where each path leads to where, as some paths might bring you back to where you started.
